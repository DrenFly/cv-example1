                <p>I think creatively about process improvement. I know my way around a spreadsheet. I like to learn. I enjoy problem solving and have a decent track record of solving them, especially technical ones. I am not discouraged by large repetitive tasks and just get stuck in. I am flexible on hours and if there is a big job I will want to stay to get it done by the deadline. I take ownership of my area of responsibility so I work to make sure no one can find fault. I like having variety and to tackle my own projects and want to be the go-to-guy for tricky issues. I have many recommendations that will bear all this out which can been seen below or on my LinkedIn page if you want to see what other people say about me. In general I look to have purpose, relevance and to make things easier by innovating.</p>
                <p> NBA, Old school Metallica, History and Web Design are my favourite hobbies. Nice to meet you!</p>
